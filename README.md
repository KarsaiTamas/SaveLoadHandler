# SaveLoadHandler
<br>Handles saving and loading from Json.</br>
<br>Default path location in SLHandler.cs is: Application.persistentDataPath + "\\" + "SaveFiles\\" you can change this if you want to handle your saves elsewhere.</br>
<br>Main reason I uploaded this to save it for my self, and made it public so other people can use it as well if they choose to.</br>
<br>This works with unity.</br>
<br>You can save and load any type with this.</br>
<br>Make sure everything which you want to save is in 1 class.</br>
<br>Make sure every class which you want to save is System.Serializable.</br>
<br>When you deleting save files ALWAYS make sure that you deleting the correct files.</br>
<br>The delete file is an in built funtion, if you delete something with it I won't take responsibility.</br>
